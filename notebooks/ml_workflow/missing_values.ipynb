    "Algorithms that Support Missing Values\n",
    "Not all algorithms fail when there is missing data.\n",
    "There are algorithms that can be made robust to missing data, such as k-Nearest Neighbors that can ignore a column from a distance measure when a value is missing.\n",
    "There are also algorithms that can use the missing value as a unique and different value when building the predictive model, such as classification and regression trees.\n",
    "Sadly, the scikit-learn implementations of decision trees and k-Nearest Neighbors are not robust to missing values. Although it is being considered.\n",
    "Nevertheless, this remains as an option if you consider using another algorithm implementation (such as xgboost) or developing your own implementation.\n",
