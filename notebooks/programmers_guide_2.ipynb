    "# Implicit Ratings\n",
    "Based on users behaviour rather than explicit ratings. For example, if a person clicks on links about technology but never about sports on a news site, that tells us something about their preferences. Another example would be keeping track of things people have bought - Amazon even has a 'frequently bought together' section on the site once you put something in your cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems with implicit ratings:\n",
    "- People don't bother rating items\n",
    "- People lie\n",
    "- People don't update ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the tricky things about implicit ratings is that if someone buys a gift, it can confuse your system. You want to try and build up a profile of the user so that your recommendations fit their preferences.\n",

    "## Item Based Filtering\n",
    "So far we've been doing user-based collaborative filtering, but this is difficult to scale and results in sparse datasets. Instead, it might be better to do item-based filtering. Here we identify products that are most similar to each other."
