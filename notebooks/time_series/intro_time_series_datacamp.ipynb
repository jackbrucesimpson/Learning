We downloaded a file from Google Trends containing the frequency over time for the search word \"diet\", which is pre-loaded in a DataFrame called diet. A first step when analyzing a time series is to visualize the data with a plot. You should be able to clearly see a gradual decrease in searches for \"diet\" throughout the calendar year, hitting a low around the December holidays, followed by a spike in searches around the new year as people make New Year's resolutions to lose weight.\n",

This is described as mean reversion in stock prices: prices tend to bounce back, or revert, towards previous levels after large moves, which are observed over time horizons of about a week. A more mathematical way to describe mean reversion is to say that stock returns are negatively autocorrelated.\n",

Use the pandas method .autocorr() to get the autocorrelation and show that the autocorrelation is negative.

This implies that while short term changes in interest rates may be uncorrelated, long term changes in interest rates are negatively autocorrelated. A daily move up or down in interest rates is unlikely to tell you anything about interest rates tomorrow, but a move in interest rates over a year can tell you something about where interest rates are going over the next year. And this makes some economic sense: over long horizons, when interest rates go up, the economy tends to slow down, which consequently causes interest rates to fall, and vice versa.\n",
