    "Do you know which algorithm is most efficient for solving a given problem? When this question comes up, keep in mind that Interviewers want to know how you approach problems, how many solutions you can come up with and how you chose the “best” option. Recursive algorithms, iterative algorithms, and greedy algorithms are among the big 3 you should know with an emphasis on recursion vs iteration."
