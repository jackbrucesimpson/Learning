# Computer Science Concepts

## Structures
Arrays, linked lists, hash tables/maps and binary trees

## Search
Breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS), and when to use one vs. the other

## Sorting
Merge Sort and Quicksort

## Algorithms
Do you know which algorithm is most efficient for solving a given problem? When this question comes up, keep in mind that Interviewers want to know how you approach problems, how many solutions you can come up with and how you chose the “best” option. Recursive algorithms, iterative algorithms, and greedy algorithms are among the big 3 you should know with an emphasis on recursion vs iteration.
