# Machine Learning Concepts

Things I'm interested in at the moment



## Supervised
This algorithm consist of a target / outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables).
- Regression
- Decision Trees/Random Forest
- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boost & Adaboost

## Unsupervised
 In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate.  It is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention.
- Apriori algorithm
- K Means
- PCA/LDA

## Reinforcement
Using this algorithm, the machine is trained to make specific decisions. It works this way: the machine is exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error.
- Markov Decision Process

## Basic Visualization
- Histogram
- Bar / Line Chart
- Box plot
- Scatter plot

## Advanced Visualization
- Heat Map
- Mosaic Map
- Map Visualization
- 3D Graphs
- Correlogram
